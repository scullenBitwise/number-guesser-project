# Number Guesser React Project

## Description:
Over the next few days, you will be building out a simple React game to firm up your understanding of components, JSX, props, state, and events. Each team member should create their own project/code, but you are welcome to work collaboratively with your teammates to discuss strategy, debug issues, etc.

Below you will see a demo of a React Number Guesser app. You can choose to build out an app very similar to this one, or you can choose to build a different type of React game (for example, a word guess game if you're a little more advanced). See below for a list of requirements.

## Requirements:
- First, build out simple wireframes for your game using [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/) or a similar tool. Use these wireframes to determine how to divide your app up into modular components.
- Create a GitHub repository for your game, and do regular adds/commits to give yourself multiple "save points" just in case something goes wrong.
- Make sure that your game has multiple components, and that you use props to pass data from parent components into child components to allow customization of the child components.
- Use state (the `useState()` hook) when needed to store data within a component. (Typically you'll do this instead of saving data in regular JS variables).
- Make sure that your game incorporates click events or other event types.
- Use conditional rendering to show and hide at least one component or section within your app.
- Personalize your game! Use styles, images, sounds, and custom text to build something you're proud of!
- Make your game safe-for-work. Nothing offensive, please.

## Bonuses:
- Deploy your game to GitHub Pages and share the url with your team so we can all try it!
- Learn a different technique for styling in React! Consider tools like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), [React Materialize](https://madewithreactjs.com/react-materialize), [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/?path=/story/home-installation--page), etc.
- Study up on the `useEffect()` hook. Find a way to implement it to trigger specified app functionality at various times in the app's lifecycle.
- If your game assigns a score, consider using a tool like Firebase to save each player's score in a database.  Then create a scoreboard component that shows the top scorers.
- Work within Git branches rather than within the main/master branch. Everytime you accomplish the goal of a branch, merge your code back into your main branch and start a new branch for the next task!
