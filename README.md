# Number Guesser React Project

## Description:
Over the next few days, you will be building out a simple React game to firm up your understanding of components, JSX, props, state, and events. Each team member should create their own game/the code within it, but you are welcome to work collaboratively with your teammates to discuss strategy, debug issues, review code, etc.

Below you will see a demo of a React Number Guesser app. You can choose to build out an app very similar to this one, or you can choose to build a different type of React game (for example, a word guess game if you're a little more advanced). See below for a list of requirements.

---------

## Requirements:

- [ ] First, build out simple wireframes for your game using [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/) or a similar tool. Use these wireframes to determine how to divide your app up into modular components.
- [ ] Create a GitHub repository for your game, and do regular adds/commits to give yourself multiple "save points" just in case something goes wrong.
- [ ] Use create-react-app to generate a brand new React app for your game: `npx create-react-app project-name-here`. If you need help getting your project linked up to a GitHub repo, please ask for help!
- [ ] Make sure that your game has multiple components, and that you use props to pass data from parent components into child components to allow customization of the child components.
- [ ] Use the demos provided in class for reference. [Here](https://github.com/scullenBitwise/react-apprenticeship) is a link to the full demo repo.
- [ ] Dig into the React or JavaScript documentation if you get stuck!
- [ ] Use state (the `useState()` hook) when needed to store data within a component. (Typically you'll do this instead of saving data in regular JS variables).
- [ ] Practice writing your component rendering logic both within the JSX (for example, using `.map()`) **AND** within component methods that you then call within the JSX.
- [ ] Make sure that your game incorporates click events or other event types.
- [ ] Use conditional rendering to show and hide at least one component or section within your app.
- [ ] Challenge yourself to use ES6 syntax whenever possible: arrow functions, destructuring, the spread operator, object property value shorthand, template literals, etc.
- [ ] Personalize your game! Use styles, images, sounds, and custom text to build something you're proud of!
- [ ] Make your game safe-for-work. Nothing offensive, please.

---------

## Bonuses:

- [ ] Deploy your game to GitHub Pages and share the url with your team so we can all try it!
- [ ] Write a detailed README.md file using best practices: [README Template](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2)
- [ ] Learn a different technique for styling in React! Consider tools like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), [React Materialize](https://madewithreactjs.com/react-materialize), [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/?path=/story/home-installation--page), etc.
- [ ] Study up on the `useEffect()` hook. Find a way to implement it to trigger specified app functionality at various times in the app's lifecycle.
- [ ] If your game assigns a score, consider using a tool like Firebase to save each player's score in a remote database. Then create a scoreboard component that shows the top scorers.
- [ ] Work within Git branches rather than within the main/master branch. Everytime you accomplish the goal of a branch, merge your code back into your main branch and start a new branch for the next task!
- [ ] Add one or more teammates to your repo as collaborators, and request a code review on your pull requests before merging them into your main branch.

## Closing Thoughts:

This is a chance to practice the skills we've learned together, and those you brought into the program. This project should be a challenge for you, but should also give you a better handle on the concepts and syntax we've learned so far. 

Your game doesn't need to be perfect. I promise though that the practice and experience you get here will be key to your pursuit of perfection down the line. Don't measure your app against anyone else's -- instead measure the skills/code within it to the code your past self wrote. Your past self is the **only** person you should be competing with.

**Ask for help when you need it -- either from your teammates or from me!!!** Don't allow yourself to get frustrated and defeated; sometimes all you need is an extra set of eyes or for someone to give you a nudge in the right direction.

Also, perhaps most importantly: celebrate the coding wins, no matter how small. And have fun!!!
